Evergreen, contamination-free, real-world, domain-specific AI evaluation framework

xbench is more than just a scoreboard ‚Äî it's a new evaluation framework with two complementary tracks, designed to measure both the intelligence frontier and real-world utility of AI systems:
- AGI Tracking: Measures core model capabilities like reasoning, tool-use, and memory
- Profession Aligned: A new class of evals grounded in workflows, environments, and business KPIs, co-designed with domain experts

We open source the dataset and evaluation code for two of our AGI Tracking benchmarks: ScienceQA and DeepSearch.

## xbench-ScienceQA
ScienceQA is part of xbench's AGI Tracking series, focused on evaluating fundamental knowledge capabilities across scientific domains. For detailed evaluation procedures and further information, please refer to the [website](https://xbench.org/#/agi/scienceqa) and Eval Card [xbench-ScienceQA.pdf](https://xbench.org/files/Eval%20Card%20xbench-ScienceQA.pdf) (Chinese version)

## Setup

Make sure to set the `*_API_KEY` environment variables before using these APIs.
By default, we use gemini-2.0-flash as the judge model, so you need to set the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable as well.

For the [OpenAI API](https://pypi.org/project/openai/):
```bash
pip install openai
```

## Running the evals
To run the evaluations, you can use the following command:
```bash
python xbench_evals.py --model <model_name> --dataset <data/ScienceQA.csv or data/DeepSearch.csv> --n-repeats <num_repeats>
```

Model name and API endpoint mappings are maintained in language_models.py, you can add your own models there.

## Notes
Benchmark data is encrypted to prevent search engine crawling and contamination, you can use the decrypt code in xbench_evals.py to get the plain text data. Please don't upload the plain text online. 

## Submit your agent
If you are developing an AI agent and would like to evaluate it using the latest version of xbench, we welcome you to contact us. Please submit a public access link of your agent, and we will complete the evaluation within an agreed timeframe and share the results with you promptly.
